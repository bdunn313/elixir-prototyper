# Elixir Prototyper

This is just a basic repository to be up and running with browsersync, browserify, less compilation, etc with laravel-elixir as a backbone.

Allows for rapid prototyping of web applications and ideas, or as a foundation for a larger web project.

## Getting Started

Fork/clone the repository, `cd` into it, and run:

    $ npm install
    $ gulp watch

Browsersync will fire up a server, and if you open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) you should be in business!
